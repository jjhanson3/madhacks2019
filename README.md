# madhacks2019
Repository for my MadHacks 2019 Project  
This year's project is supposed to make the world more environmentally friendly.  
I am creating a carpool app that will allow users to look for rides as well as give rides to other users.  
They will be able to do this through scheduling a ride for a specific date and time, and they can get to know other users to create enjoyable rides by putting hobbies as well as music tastes on their profile.
